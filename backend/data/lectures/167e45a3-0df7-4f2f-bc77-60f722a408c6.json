      "script": "Hello everyone, and welcome to our deep dive into a truly fascinating and disruptive development in artificial intelligence: the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, or HRM. For many years, we've operated under a quiet assumption in AI development: that bigger models inherently lead to better reasoning capabilities. This belief has driven much of the research and investment in large language models, or LLMs. However, the Hierarchical Reasoning Model has politely, but firmly, broken this rule. It's a small model, yet it demonstrates remarkably deep reasoning. This model has significant implications for how we think about intelligence and architecture in AI. In this lecture, we will thoroughly explore what HRM is, how it works, and why its design principles are so important. This is very important, as it shifts our perspective from just scaling up, to considering alternative architectural approaches.",

      ],
      "script": "Now let us understand the results that truly sparked a conversation and, frankly, disbelief within the AI community. The Hierarchical Reasoning Model, or HRM, achieved something remarkable. It uses only approximately 27 million parameters. To put this in perspective, modern frontier models like Claude, GPT, Gemini, or Grok, typically range from 500 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Furthermore, HRM was trained on roughly only 1,000 examples, and it did not involve any large-scale pretraining, which is a standard and very expensive practice for large language models. Despite these humble beginnings, HRM achieved about 32% on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark and demonstrated measurable performance on ARC-AGI-2. Comparing these raw facts to the multi-trillion-parameter models, trained on vast swaths of the internet, makes HRM\u2019s achievement intellectually disruptive. It challenges our preconceived notions about what is possible with smaller, more focused architectures.",

      "script": "Let us now delve into what HRM actually is. This model, developed by Sapient Research and released in June, is a brain-inspired reasoning architecture. It's designed around two fundamental ideas that many modern large language models, or LLMs, largely overlook. The first idea is Recurrence, which essentially means thinking over time. And the second is Hierarchical time scales, which means thinking at different speeds or levels. Unlike traditional models that often produce an answer in a single, straightforward pass, HRM reasons over time. It begins with an initial internal guess, then it refines this guess, checks it, and refines it again. This process continues until the system reaches a stable or 'equilibrium' state. This is very important because it transforms reasoning from a static prediction task into a dynamic, ongoing process. This shift, though it might sound subtle at first, is profoundly significant.",

      ],
      "script": "Now, let us understand why this model is called 'Hierarchical.' The design of HRM is deeply inspired by how real systems work, both in biology and in physics. It consists of two primary interacting components: a Fast Layer and a Slow Layer. The Fast Layer is responsible for rapid, local updates, handling immediate and granular information. In contrast, the Slow Layer focuses on global context and summarization, integrating broader patterns. This is very important: the fast layer depends on the slow one, meaning its local updates are guided by the global context. Conversely, the slow layer integrates information that comes from repeated updates of the fast layer, creating a continuous feedback loop. This architecture mirrors how signals operate at different frequencies in the brain, or how physics engines use high-frequency inner loops for dynamics while low-frequency outer loops maintain stability. HRM applies this same principle to the very process of reasoning itself.",

      "script": "Let us now delve deeper into the concept of Reasoning as Iterative Refinement, which is a cornerstone of HRM's philosophy. Traditional transformer models typically treat reasoning as a single, forward pass through a fixed stack of layers. You input something, and you get an output. It's a linear process. HRM, however, adopts a fundamentally different pattern. It approaches reasoning more like an iterative refinement process. The pattern it follows is closer to: Initial state, followed by refinement, then more refinement, leading eventually to convergence. What this means is that with each iteration, the model continuously improves its internal representation of the problem or the task at hand, until it reaches a state of equilibrium or stability. This design makes HRM particularly strong and effective on tasks that require correction, tasks involving backtracking, or those demanding gradual discovery. These are exactly the kinds of problems that benchmarks like ARC-AGI were specifically designed to test.",

      ],
      "script": "Now, let's explore why this particular design works so effectively for HRM. HRM\u2019s remarkable performance does not come from scaling up its size in terms of parameters. Instead, it comes from what we call 'leverage.' This is very important. For example, HRM achieves its effective depth not by stacking many, many layers, but through the iterative process we just discussed. Each refinement step contributes to its depth of processing, without needing an exorbitant number of parameters. Secondly, it learns truly complex reasoning abilities from a surprisingly tiny number of examples, unlike large models needing vast datasets. And thirdly, its training process remains stable because it avoids the computationally expensive full backpropagation through time. In simple terms, HRM gets more thinking capacity out of each parameter it possesses. This efficiency is a core strength and a key reason behind its ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks with a relatively small footprint.",

      "script": "Let us now compare the philosophical underpinnings of traditional Transformers and the Hierarchical Reasoning Model. They represent very different approaches to intelligence. Transformers, particularly large language models, excel at reasoning through language. They often externalize their thought process directly as text, allowing us to see their steps. HRM, on the other hand, reasons internally. It refines its understanding through changes in its hidden states, without necessarily verbalizing or writing down its thought process. One narrates its thinking for us to see, while the other primarily just 'does' the thinking. It is crucial to understand that neither of these approaches is meant to completely replace the other. Instead, they are complementary. They each point towards different, but equally valid and exciting, futures for AI development. This distinction is very important because it helps us appreciate the unique strengths of each architecture.",

      "script": "It's important for us to clarify why directly comparing HRM to GPT-class models, or other large language models, can be misleading. Large language models are designed as general-purpose systems. They are built to perform a wide array of tasks: writing, summarizing, conversing, and reasoning \u2013 predominantly through language. Their reasoning capabilities often emerge indirectly from their vast scale and the immense data they are trained on. However, HRM is doing something fundamentally different. It is not designed to be a conversational assistant or a universal model for all tasks. Instead, it is narrowly and specifically focused on structured reasoning. This includes tasks such as solving logic puzzles, grasping abstraction, and discovering underlying rules. For example, trying to compare HRM to GPT-4 is much like comparing a Formula 1 engine to a cargo ship. Both are incredibly impressive feats of engineering, but they are built to solve entirely different problems with different constraints and objectives. The real question HRM poses is: What if reasoning isn't about sheer size, but about structure and time?",

It strongly suggests that intelligence, in an AI context, is not solely a function of scale \u2013 of simply adding more and more parameters. Instead, it is also deeply tied to architecture, to hierarchy, and crucially, to the element of time in reasoning. The model reminds us that AI still has a great deal to learn from how real reasoning systems, such as biological brains, operate. Brains figured out these principles of structure and time long ago. This breakthrough quiety puts a powerful promise on the table: the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence may not arise from simply adding more parameters. Instead, it might come from teaching our models how to think longer, more carefully, and only when necessary. This is a very important shift in perspective.",

We've learned that HRM is a truly innovative, brain-inspired architecture, remarkably small with approximately 27 million parameters. Despite its size, it achieves deep reasoning by leveraging iterative refinement and hierarchical time scales. This approach fundamentally challenges the long-held assumption that sheer scale is the only path to advanced reasoning in AI. We understood that HRM should not be directly compared to general-purpose large language models; rather, it offers a complementary perspective, focusing on structured reasoning. This is very important: HRM's success suggests that the future of AI breakthroughs may lie not just in making models larger, but in designing them with smarter architectures, effective hierarchies, and by incorporating the crucial element of 'thinking over time.' It encourages us to look beyond brute force and towards more elegant, biologically inspired solutions for intelligence. Thank you.",
