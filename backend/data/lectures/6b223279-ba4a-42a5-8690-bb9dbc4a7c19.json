      "script": "Good morning, class! Today, we're going to dive into a truly fascinating topic in the world of artificial intelligence: the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, or HRM. For many years, we've lived with a quiet but powerful assumption in AI development: that bigger models with more parameters inherently lead to better reasoning capabilities. This belief has driven much of the research and development in large language models we see today. However, a model called HRM has emerged, and it has politely, but firmly, broken this rule. It's truly intellectually disruptive. Now let us understand why this model is so important. Imagine a model with only 27 million parameters, outperforming giants like Opus 4, GPT-4.5, and o3 on a complex benchmark like ARC-AGI, and doing so without extensive pretraining. This isn't just impressive; it forces us to rethink our fundamental understanding of intelligence in AI. This shift is what we will explore in our lecture today, understanding its implications for the future of AI. This is very important.",

      "script": "Now, let's look at the raw facts that sparked so much conversation and disbelief around HRM. This is very important. The numbers truly are worth pausing on. The Hierarchical Reasoning Model utilizes approximately 27 million parameters. To put this into perspective, it was trained on roughly only 1,000 examples, and crucially, no large-scale pretraining was involved in its development. Despite these modest resources, it achieved around 32% on ARC-AGI-1 and also showed measurable performance on ARC-AGI-2. In stark contrast, modern frontier models, such as Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok, operate in the range of 500 billion to even 2 trillion parameters. They are trained on vast swaths of the entire internet and require enormous computational budgets. At first glance, comparing HRM to these massive models might seem natural, but in reality, it completely misses the point of what HRM is designed to do. HRM is asking a different kind of question about intelligence, focusing on structure and time rather than sheer size.",

      "script": "So, what exactly is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, or HRM? Let us understand its core design. HRM, developed by Sapient Research, is a brain-inspired reasoning architecture. This means it draws inspiration from how real biological systems, like our own brains, process information. It is built around two key ideas that most modern large language models, or LLMs, largely overlook. The first is Recurrence, which signifies 'thinking over time'. The second is Hierarchical time scales, meaning 'thinking at different speeds'. Instead of simply producing an answer in a single, one-shot forward pass, as many traditional models do, HRM reasons over time. It initiates with an internal guess, a sort of hypothesis. Then, it iteratively refines this guess, checks its validity, and refines it again. This process continues until the system reaches a stable or 'equilibrium' state. This is very important: reasoning in HRM becomes a dynamic process, one that evolves and improves over time, rather than a fixed, static prediction. This shift, though it might sound subtle at first, is truly profound.",

      "script": "Now, let's delve deeper into why HRM is specifically called 'Hierarchical'. This design is directly inspired by how many real-world systems function, whether they are biological or physical. HRM consists of two primary layers that interact in a structured way. First, we have the Fast Layer. This layer is responsible for rapid and local updates within the model. Think of it as handling immediate, fine-grained details. Second, there is the Slow Layer. This layer focuses on maintaining global context and performing summarization across the information. It provides the broader understanding. The key here is their relationship: the Fast Layer depends on the Slow Layer for overarching guidance, while the Slow Layer integrates information that comes from repeated updates generated by the Fast Layer. For example, this mirrors how signals operate at different frequencies in the brain, with some processing immediate sensory input and others handling long-term memory. Similarly, in physics engines, high-frequency inner loops manage dynamic movements, while lower-frequency outer loops ensure overall system stability. HRM applies this exact same principle directly to the process of reasoning itself.",

      ],
      "script": "Let us now understand another critical aspect of HRM's unique approach: its view of reasoning as an iterative refinement process. This is very important. Traditional transformer models, which are widely used today, typically treat reasoning as a single, straightforward pass through a fixed stack of computational layers. They take an input, process it once, and produce an output. However, HRM adopts a fundamentally different philosophy. It treats reasoning as a process of iterative refinement. Instead of a simple 'Input to Output' flow, HRM follows a pattern that is much closer to this: It starts with an 'Initial state', then moves through 'refinement', then another 'refinement', and finally reaches 'convergence'. What does this mean in practice? It means that each iteration in HRM\u2019s process significantly improves its internal representation of the problem. This continues until the model reaches a state of equilibrium, where further refinements yield little change. This makes HRM particularly strong on tasks that naturally require correction, tasks that might involve backtracking to a previous state, or problems that demand gradual discovery of a solution. These are exactly the kinds of challenging problems that benchmarks like ARC were specifically designed to test.",

      "heading": "Why This Design Works: The Power of Leverage, Not Scale",
      "summary": "This section explains that HRM's exceptional performance is not derived from its size, but from its architectural 'leverage,' enabling it to achieve effective depth and learn from minimal examples while maintaining training stability.",

      ],
      "script": "Now, you might be wondering, how does this design translate into such impressive performance for HRM? The key lies in understanding that HRM's performance doesn't stem from sheer scale, but from what we call 'leverage'. This is a very important distinction. HRM achieves effective depth in its reasoning process not by simply stacking more layers or increasing parameters, but through its iterative nature. Each refinement step deepens its understanding. For example, it learns incredibly complex reasoning capabilities from a surprisingly tiny number of examples, which is a significant departure from data-hungry large models. Furthermore, HRM remains remarkably stable during its training phase. This stability is partly due to its design, which avoids the need for expensive full backpropagation through time. In essence, by cleverly structuring its reasoning, HRM gets more 'thinking per parameter'. It optimizes the usage of its resources, demonstrating that intelligent behavior can be an outcome of efficient architecture and process, rather than just raw computational power and vast datasets.",

      "script": "Let's take a moment to consider the fundamental difference in philosophy between traditional transformers and HRM. This contrast is very important for understanding their roles in AI. Transformers, which we are all quite familiar with, excel at reasoning primarily through language. They often externalize their thought process, articulating steps or generating explanations as text. In a way, we can say that a transformer narrates its thinking. On the other hand, HRM approaches reasoning internally. It refines its understanding through hidden-state changes, within its own internal representations, without necessarily translating that into explicit language during the reasoning process. It does the thinking internally. Now, it\u2019s crucial to understand that neither approach is meant to entirely replace the other. They are not in direct competition in that sense. Instead, they point toward different, yet complementary, futures for artificial intelligence. Some problems might benefit from explicit, narrativized reasoning, while others might benefit more from deep, internal, iterative refinement. Understanding this philosophical difference helps us appreciate the diverse paths AI research is exploring.",

      "script": "Now, let us discuss a very important point that often leads to misunderstanding: Why HRM should not be directly compared to GPT-class models. Large language models, like those in the GPT family, are designed as general-purpose systems. Their objective is broad: to write creative text, summarize complex information, engage in natural conversation, and yes, also to reason \u2013 though their reasoning ability often emerges indirectly from their vast scale and training data. HRM, however, is doing something entirely different. It is not attempting to be a conversational assistant, nor is it striving to be a universal, all-encompassing model. Instead, HRM is narrowly and specifically focused on structured reasoning. This is the kind of reasoning required for solving logic puzzles, grasping abstract concepts, and discovering underlying rules. For example, comparing HRM to GPT-4 is much like comparing a Formula 1 engine to a cargo ship. Both are incredibly impressive feats of engineering, but they are built with entirely different purposes in mind and are solving distinct problems. The true question HRM asks is not about size, but about the fundamental structure and the time aspects of reasoning.",

Instead, it serves as a powerful complement, by showcasing a fundamentally different path forward for AI development. It strongly suggests that true intelligence is not solely a function of scale, meaning adding more and more parameters, but rather, it is deeply intertwined with architecture, hierarchy, and the dimension of time. Our own brains, for example, figured this out a very long time ago, operating with intricate structures and temporal dynamics. HRM is a potent reminder that AI still has a tremendous amount to learn from how real, organic reasoning systems actually work. The next major breakthrough in AI may not come from simply making models even larger. Instead, it might emerge from teaching models how to think longer, how to think more carefully, and perhaps most importantly, how to think only when it is truly necessary. This is the profound promise that HRM quietly places on the table for us to consider.",

We learned that HRM is a truly disruptive architecture that challenges the long-standing assumption that bigger models always mean better reasoning.

Its core design is brain-inspired, centered around recurrence\u2014thinking over time\u2014and hierarchical time scales, which means thinking at different speeds through its fast and slow layers. We also explored how HRM approaches reasoning as an iterative refinement process, continuously improving its internal state rather than relying on a single pass. This unique design provides leverage, delivering more 'thinking per parameter' by achieving effective depth through iteration. Finally, we discussed that HRM is not competing with general-purpose LLMs but complements them, offering a different philosophical path for AI. It suggests that intelligence is about architecture, hierarchy, and time, providing valuable lessons from how real reasoning systems operate. Thank you for your attention.
